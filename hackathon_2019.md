We are excited to announce that thanks to funding from the Royal Society of Chemistry Higher Education Group we will be hosting a pythoninchemistry hackathon in late January 2020 at the University of Bath.

The aim of this event will be to develop open source teaching resources (in Python) for use in the chemistry undergraduate curriculum.
In the coming months we will be crowdsourcing ideas for particular resources and on the day groups (consisting of both experts in programming and education) will work together to develop these resources.

Limited funds mean that the number of attendees will be limited, however, lunch and travel costs (for students and early career researchers) will be included.

More details will follow, but if you are interested in getting involved please [reach out](mailto:a.r.mccluskey@bath.ac.uk), and we will include you in any future communication.
