We will be hosting the first [pythoninchemistry](https://pythoninchemsitry.org) hackathon in January 2020 at the University of Bath.

The aim of this event is to develop prototype open-source teaching resources (in Python) for use in the chemistry undergraduate curriculum. 
In the coming months we will be crowdsourcing ideas for resources that people think would be useful, or interesting, or ideally both. 
During the hackathon, attendees will work in small groups containing experts in both programming and education, to design and then prototype new python-based teaching resources. 

Numbers are limited to 30. 
Attendance is free, and lunch will be provided. 
Thanks to generous funding from the Royal Society of Chemistry Higher Education Group and the University of Bath, we are able to reimburse travel costs for students and early career researchers who attend the hackathon.

We will update this page with more details as these are ironed out. 
If you are interested in being involved, please [contact us](mailto:a.r.mccluskey@bath.ac.uk) and we will keep you updated.
