**Unfortunately, the Hackathon was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope to rearrange this event for 2021**. 

The aim of this event is to bring together experts in education, experts in programming, and students, to explore the development of interactive Python-based teaching resources for use by chemistry undergraduates.
The hackathon aims to develop prototype resources that give students access to programmatic models that demonstrate and explain chemical concepts, while also introducing them to how the underlying code makes this possible.

- Anyone with an interest in chemistry education is asked to complete the request an invitation form online.
- **No coding experience necessary!**
- Limited funding is available to support student travel to this event.
- Lunch will be provided.
- This event was made possible by financial support from the Royal Society of Chemistry Higher Education Group and the University of Bath.
