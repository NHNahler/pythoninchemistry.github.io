# Contributing a Resource

Thanks for your interest in contributing an educational resource! 
This short, is that there are two approaches to do this: linking to an existing open resource or adding your resource directly to the Python in Chemistry repositories. 
Either way, it is vital that the following conditions are met:
- Your resource must be shared with an open licence (i.e., [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))
- You must identify all of the contributors to the resource (this is most easily done by making the resource a Git repository)

With these conditions met, please see below for approach-specific guidence.
