# Contributing a Resource

Thanks for your interest in contributing an educational resource! 
There are two approaches to do this: linking to an existing open resource or adding your resource directly to the Python in Chemistry repositories. 
Either way, it is vital that the following conditions are met:
- Your resource must be shared with an open licence (i.e., [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))
- You must identify all of the contributors to the resource (this is most easily done by making the resource a Git repository)

With these conditions met, please see below for approach-specific guidence. 

## Linking to an Existing Resource

If you want to link an existing resource, please [edit the linked-resources file](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/pythoninchemistry.github.io/blob/master/educational-resources/linked-resources.md) on Github (click the pen icon to edit), add your resource to the list, commit your changes, and open a pull request on the repository. 
We will try to address your pull request as soon as possible. 
Please follow the format of the other resources in the list, i.e., including a name for the resource, and the host organisation. 

## Adding Your Resource Directly

To add your resource directly to the pythoninchemistry organisation, please contact [Andrew R. McCluskey](mailto:andrew.mccluskey@bristol.ac.uk) to discuss how to transfer the GitHub repository.
