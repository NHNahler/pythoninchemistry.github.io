## Goals of the Meeting

One of the conclusions of the [2024 Python in Chemistry Meeting](https://pythoninchemistry.org/state-of-teaching.html) was the need to support colleagues to make their first steps in computing education, and the desire to produce shared resources which can be used in and adapted for a variety of contexts, removing the need for every Python instructor to start from scratch independently. Therefore, the goal of this year's meeting is to collectively produce such a resource, aimed initially at academic staff who are interested in getting started with Python. We hope to finish the meeting with resources which can be easily accessed by anyone, regardless of their programming background, which will both introduce the fundamentals of Python and begin to demonstrate its use in chemistry research and education. If you have suggestions of topics which should be covered by this tool, please add to the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/pythoninchemistry/discussions/2)!
